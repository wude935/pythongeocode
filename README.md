A script written to help convert a txt file of address to geocodes.

## Installation

Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your PC.  
Next, install geopy:

> pip3 install geopy --user

## Notes

- Because Geopy uses APIs from other organizations, you may be rate limited or pay for more requests. This script uses the free API from Nominatim.
- Geopy may error out or provide inaccurate values if the address is not formatted correctly. Try spelling out any abbreviations when inputing addresses.
